                <p>Estes Park native <strong>Blake</strong> won the <em>27th Front Range Marathon</em> over an elite field of the best
                    long-distance runners in the country. Laura's time of <em>2 hr. 28 min. 21 sec.</em> was only 2 minutes off
                    the women's course record set last year by Sarah Rawlings. <strong>Kathy Lasker</strong> and <strong>Lisa Peterson</strong> finished
                    second and third, respectively. <strong>Laura</strong>'s victory came on the heels of her performance at the NCAA
                    Track and Field Championships, in which she placed second running for Colorado State.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>an exciting race, <strong>Peter Teagan</strong> of San Antonio, Texas, used a finishing kick to win the <em>men's
                    marathon</em> for the second straight year, in a time of <em>2 hr. 12 min. 34 sec.</em> Ahead for much of the
                    race, <strong>Kyle Wills</strong> of <em>Billings, Montana</em> , finished <em>second</em> when he could not match Teagan's finishing
                    pace. <strong>Jason Wu</strong> of <em> Boulder, Colorado</em>, placed third in a very competitive field.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This year's race through downtown Boulder boasted the <em>largest field in the marathon's history</em>, with
                    <strong>over 9500 men and 6700 women competing</strong>. Race conditions were perfect with low humidity and
                    temperatures that never exceeded 85 degrees.</p>

            <li>
                <p> Highway 7 will reopen this <strong>Friday, June 3rd</strong>, after a final safety inspection. A late blizzard
                    delayed road crews, marking this as one of the <em>latest dates on record for the highway's reopening</em>.

            <li>
                <p> Rising to an elevation of over <strong>12,000 feet</strong>, Highway 7 is a main link between <em>Estes Park and Grand
                    Lake</em>. The reopening of the road is one of the annual signs that summer is near and the tourist
                    season will soon be upon us! </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p> Cougar sightings have  <strong>increased 40%</strong> in the Este Park area according to a report released yesterday
                    by the state DNR. In the last month alone, there were <em>ten sightings</em> in Estes Park and the
                    surrounding communities of <strong>Grand Lake</strong> and <strong>Pinewood Springs</strong>. This compares to only twelve sightings
                    for the entire spring of last year. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> Reasons for the growing number of cougar sightings include <em>increasing encroachment</em> by people into
                    former wildlife habitats and <em>new wildlife regulations</em> that result in decreasing numbers of elk and
                    deer being taken by hunters. Cougars may be wandering into developed areas, following the herds.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> DNR spokesman Steve Tasker asks residents to call the DNR report line at 555-6981 if they believe
                    they have seen a cougar or any large predatory animal. <strong>Two fatalities</strong> have already occurred in the
                    west this year from cougar attacks. </p>

                <p> Try to <em>appear larger</em> than the cougar by <strong>raising your arms</strong>. </p>

            <li>
                <p> <em>If the cougar displays aggressive behavior</em>, <strong>shout and wave your arms</strong>. Convince the cougar that you
                    are not prey, but a potential danger. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
